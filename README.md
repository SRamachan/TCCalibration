# Temperature_sensors_calibration
Python codes for calibrating a type K thermocouple and a negative temperature coefficient thermistor. Sample xlxs data files are provided.
Two sample data files in xlxs format are provided, one for a type K thermocouple and the other for a thermistor. Please click on each of them to learn how your data should be input into the Python code. 
Please use gitclone to import the .ipynb note book and the Excel data. 
After you become familiar with the codes, do not forget to import your OWN data into your own JupyterHub environment so that the codes can fit a curve to your own data.
